## Prepare SDK & Adding Keys üîë

you can put it into your AppDelegate.swift file like this :

```ruby
import UIKit

@main
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    var window:UIWindow?

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        // Override point for customization after application launch.
        CirclePay.merchantToken = "Your Merchant Token"
        CirclePay.accountToken = "Your Account Token"
        CirclePay.accountKey = " Your Account Key"
        CirclePay.prepareSDK()
        let window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)
        window.rootViewController = InitialViewController()
        self.window = window
        window.makeKeyAndVisible()
        return true
    }
}
